                <p> In 2019, hydropower supplied 16% of the world's electricity, down from a high of nearly 20% in the mid-to-late 20th century. The uranium ore used to fuel nuclear fission plants is a non-renewable resource, but sufficient quantities exist to provide a supply for hundreds of years. Ending these could lead to a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths.</p>
