                <p> Wider access to reliable electricity would lead to less use of kerosene lighting and diesel generators, which are currently common in the developing world. The ensuing success of this installation enabled Hammond to put this venture on both a commercial and legal footing, as a number of shop owners wanted to use the new electric light. The industry is generally heavily regulated, often with price controls and is frequently government-owned and operated.</p>
