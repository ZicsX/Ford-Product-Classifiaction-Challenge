                <p> Hydrogen can be produced when there is a surplus of intermittent renewable electricity, then stored and used to generate heat or to re-generate electricity. The energy efficiency of cars has increased as a consequence of technological progress, but shifting to electric vehicles is an important further step towards decarbonising transport and reducing air pollution.Although electricity had been known to be produced as a result of the chemical reactions that take place in an electrolytic cell since Alessandro Volta developed the voltaic pile in 1800, its production by this means was, and still is, expensive.</p>
