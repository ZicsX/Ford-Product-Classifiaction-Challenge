                <p>Infrastructure for generating and storing renewable electricity requires minerals and metals, such as cobalt and lithium for batteries and copper for solar panels. Improvements in energy efficiency slowed in the years between 2015 and 2018, in part because of consumer preferences for bigger cars. The uranium ore used to fuel nuclear fission plants is a non-renewable resource, but sufficient quantities exist to provide a supply for hundreds of years.</p>
