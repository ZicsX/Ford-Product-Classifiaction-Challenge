                <p> Heat can be obtained by drilling into the ground and then carried by a heat-transfer fluid such as water, brine or steam. For example, nuclear power is a low-carbon source and has a safety record comparable to wind and solar, but its sustainability has been debated due to concerns about nuclear proliferation, radioactive waste and accidents. Unfortunately it also increases the danger from direct contact and increases the required insulation thickness.</p>
