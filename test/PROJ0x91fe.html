                <p> Fossil fuel switching and mitigation For a given unit of energy produced, the life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of natural gas are around 40 times the emissions of wind or nuclear energy, but much less than that of coal.While HVDC is increasingly being used to transmit large quantities of electricity over long distances or to connect adjacent asynchronous power systems, the bulk of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retailing takes place using alternating current. The cost of electricity from new solar farms is competitive with, or in many places cheaper than, electricity from existing coal plants.</p>
