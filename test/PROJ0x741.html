                <p> In some countries, wholesale electricity markets operate, with generators and retailers trading electricity in a similar manner to shares and currency. AC power had an advantage in that transformers, installed at power stations, could be used to raise the voltage from the generators, and transformers at local substations could reduce voltage to supply loads. Technology will probably eventually declare the most preferred forms, but in a market economy, the options with less overall costs generally will be chosen above other sources.</p>
