                <p> With grid energy storage, energy produced in excess can be released when needed. If 90% of emitted CO2 is captured from a coal-fired power plant, its uncaptured emissions would still be many times greater than the emissions of nuclear, solar, or wind energy per unit of electricity produced. For this reason, electric power is viewed as a natural monopoly.</p>
