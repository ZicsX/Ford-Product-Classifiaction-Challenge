                <p>Manufacturing in the Soviet Union was based on collectivism. Morality in this absolute sense solidifies in the dialogues of Plato, together with the emergence of monotheistic thought (notably in Euthyphro, which ponders the concept of piety (τὸ ὅσιον) as a moral absolute). Good is that which should prevail and evil should be defeated.</p>
