                <p> In Western civilisation, the basic meanings of κακός and ἀγαθός are "bad, cowardly" and "good, brave, capable", and their absolute sense emerges only around 400 BC, with Pre-Socratic philosophy, in particular Democritus.The mechanized assembly line was introduced to assemble parts in a repeatable fashion, with individual workers performing specific steps during the process.
