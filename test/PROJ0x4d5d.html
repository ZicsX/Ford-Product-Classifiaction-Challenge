                <p> The uranium ore used to fuel nuclear fission plants is a non-renewable resource, but sufficient quantities exist to provide a supply for hundreds of years. Off-grid and mini-grid systems based on renewable energy, such as small solar PV installations that generate and store enough electricity for a village, are important solutions for rural areas. As of 2018, about a quarter of all electricity generation came from renewable sources other than biomass, and electricity generation has seen a much faster uptake of renewables than the heat and transport sectors.</p>
