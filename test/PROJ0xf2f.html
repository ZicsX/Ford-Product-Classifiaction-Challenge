                <p> Limiting global warming to levels consistent with the Paris Agreement will require system-wide transformation of the way energy is produced, distributed, stored, and consumed. It defined sustainable development as development that "meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Climate change mitigation pathways that are in line with these goals show energy usage remaining around the same between 2010 and 2030, and then increase slightly by 2050.</p>
