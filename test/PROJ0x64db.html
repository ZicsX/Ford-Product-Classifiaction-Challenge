                <p> It was for this reason that the generation was close to or on the consumer's premises as Edison had no means of voltage conversion. AC power had an advantage in that transformers, installed at power stations, could be used to raise the voltage from the generators, and transformers at local substations could reduce voltage to supply loads.</p>
