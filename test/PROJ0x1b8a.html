                <p> The first random-access digital storage device was the Williams tube, based on a standard cathode ray tube, but the information stored in it and delay line memory was volatile in that it had to be continuously refreshed, and thus was lost once power was removed. Although it was programmable, it was not general-purpose, being designed to perform only a single task. Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media.</p>
