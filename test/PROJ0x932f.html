                <p> Ambitious climate policy would see a doubling of energy consumed as electricity by 2050, from 20% in 2020. As larger amounts of solar and wind energy are integrated into the grid, changes have to be made to the energy system to ensure that the supply of electricity is matched to demand.  Carbon capture and storage technology can be built into power plants to remove their carbon dioxide emissions, but is expensive and has seldom been implemented.</p>
