                <p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 40% of greenhouse gas emission reductions needed to fulfill the Paris agreement can be achieved by increasing energy efficiency. Improving energy access in the least-developed countries, and making energy cleaner, are key to achieving most of the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, which cover issues ranging from climate action to gender equality. Developing natural gas infrastructure risks the creation of carbon lock-in and stranded assets, where new fossil infrastructure either commits to decades of carbon emissions, or has to be written off prematurely.</p>
