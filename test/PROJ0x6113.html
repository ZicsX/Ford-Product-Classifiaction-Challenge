                <p> There is potential for hydrogen to play a significant role in decarbonising energy systems because in certain sectors, replacing fossil fuels with direct use of electricity would be very difficult. Depending on location, clean fuels for cooking are typically liquified petroleum gas (LPG), locally-produced biogas, piped natural gas (PNG), or alcohol. In health clinics, electricity is required for operation of medical equipment, refrigeration of vaccines and medications, and lighting, but a 2018 survey in six Asian and African countries found that half of health facilities had no or poor access to electricity.</p>
