                <p>Hydropower is the largest renewable electricity source while solar and wind have seen substantial growth and progress over the last few years; photovoltaic solar and onshore wind are the cheapest forms of adding new power generation capacity in most countries. The DC system was able to claim slightly greater safety, but this difference was not great enough to overwhelm the enormous technical and economic advantages of alternating current which eventually won out. Transport can be made cleaner and healthier by stimulating nonmotorised transport such as walking and cycling, particularly in cities.</p>
