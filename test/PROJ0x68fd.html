                <p> IMS stores data hierarchically, but in the 1970s Ted Codd proposed an alternative relational storage model based on set theory and predicate logic and the familiar concepts of tables, rows ,and columns.In recent years, the extensible markup language (XML) has become a popular format for data representation. Anything stored is data, but it only becomes information when it is organized and presented meaningfully.</p>
