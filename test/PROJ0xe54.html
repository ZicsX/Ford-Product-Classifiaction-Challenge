                <p> In Western civilisation, the basic meanings of κακός and ἀγαθός are "bad, cowardly" and "good, brave, capable", and their absolute sense emerges only around 400 BC, with Pre-Socratic philosophy, in particular Democritus. This form is the basis for understanding all other forms, it is what allows us to understand everything else.</p>
