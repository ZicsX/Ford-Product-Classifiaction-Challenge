                <p> Turbine blades are not fully recyclable; research into methods of manufacturing easier-to-recycle blades is ongoing. This has occurred prominently since the reform of the electricity supply industry in England and Wales in 1990. While such markets can be abusively manipulated with consequent adverse price and reliability impact to consumers, generally competitive production of electrical energy leads to worthwhile improvements in efficiency.</p>
