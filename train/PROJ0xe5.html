                <p> Power electronics started with the development of the mercury arc rectifier in 1902, used to convert AC into DC. Individual consumers can also choose to conserve energy by, for example, reducing their air travel. For a given amount of power transmitted, increasing the voltage reduces the current and therefore reduces the required wire thickness.</p>
