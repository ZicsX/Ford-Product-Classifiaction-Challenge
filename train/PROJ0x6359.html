                <p> Aristotle argues that Plato's Form of the Good does not apply to the physical world, for Plato does not assign "goodness" to anything in the existing world. The first references that are seen in Plato's The Republic to the Form of the Good are within the conversation between Glaucon and Socrates (454câ€“d). Rawls defined justice as fairness, especially in distributing social goods, defined fairness in terms of procedures, and attempted to prove that just institutions and lives are good, if every rational individual's goods are considered fairly.</p>
