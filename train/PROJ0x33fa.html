Oil spills at sea harm marine life and may cause fires which release toxic emissions. If 90% of emitted CO2 is captured from a coal-fired power plant, its uncaptured emissions would still be many times greater than the emissions of nuclear, solar, or wind energy per unit of electricity produced.</p>
