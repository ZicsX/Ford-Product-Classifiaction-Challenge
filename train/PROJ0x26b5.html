                <p> Aristotle argues that Plato's Form of the Good does not apply to the physical world, for Plato does not assign "goodness" to anything in the existing world.For the western world, this idea developed into a religion which spawned many sects, some of which embraced an extreme dualistic belief that the material world should be shunned and the spiritual world should be embraced. The first references that are seen in Plato's The Republic to the Form of the Good are within the conversation between Glaucon and Socrates (454câ€“d).</p>
