                <p> In health clinics, electricity is required for operation of medical equipment, refrigeration of vaccines and medications, and lighting, but a 2018 survey in six Asian and African countries found that half of health facilities had no or poor access to electricity. The commercial distribution of electric power started in 1882 when electricity was produced for electric lighting. Customers demanding a much larger amount of power may be connected directly to the primary distribution level or the subtransmission level.</p>
