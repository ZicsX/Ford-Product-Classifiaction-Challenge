                <p> Hydrogen fuel can produce the intense heat required for industrial production of steel, cement, glass, and chemicals. Many of the techniques needed to lower emissions from shipping and aviation are still early in their development, with clean ammonia a promising candidate for shipping fuel. If biomass is harvested from crops, such as tree plantations, the cultivation of these crops can displace natural ecosystems, degrade soils, and consume water resources and synthetic fertilizers.</p>
