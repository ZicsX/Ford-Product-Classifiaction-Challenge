                <p> AC and DC competed for a while, during a period called the war of the currents. Commercial and residential customers are connected to the secondary distribution lines through service drops. AC power had an advantage in that transformers, installed at power stations, could be used to raise the voltage from the generators, and transformers at local substations could reduce voltage to supply loads.</p>
