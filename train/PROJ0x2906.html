                <p> Transistor technology dates back to 1947, with the invention of the point-contact transistor, which was followed by the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) in 1948. Average annual investment in low-carbon energy technologies and energy efficiency would need to be upscaled by roughly a factor of six by 2050 compared to 2015. However, some renewable energy projects, such as the clearing of forests for the production of biofuels, can cause severe environmental damage.</p>
