                <p> IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies. All databases are common in one point that the structure of the data they contain is defined and stored separately from the data itself, in a database schema.Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development: pre-mechanical (3000 BC – 1450 AD), mechanical (1450–1840), electromechanical (1840–1940), and electronic (1940–present).</p>
