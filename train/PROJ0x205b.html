                <p> Nearly all of it is produced from fossil fuels, which results in high greenhouse gas emissions. As larger amounts of solar and wind energy are integrated into the grid, changes have to be made to the energy system to ensure that the supply of electricity is matched to demand. While both bats and to a lesser extent birds are killed by collisions, these impacts are smaller than from other infrastructure such as windows and transmission lines.</p>
