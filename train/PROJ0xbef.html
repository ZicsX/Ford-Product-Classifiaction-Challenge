                <p> Climate change mitigation pathways that are consistent with ambitious goals typically see an increase in power supply from nuclear, but growth is not strictly necessary. In some cases, these impacts can actually result in higher overall carbon emissions compared to using petroleum-based fuels. For example, nuclear power is a low-carbon source and has a safety record comparable to wind and solar, but its sustainability has been debated due to concerns about nuclear proliferation, radioactive waste and accidents.</p>
