                <p> In many countries, electric power companies own the whole infrastructure from generating stations to transmission and distribution infrastructure. As larger amounts of solar and wind energy are integrated into the grid, changes have to be made to the energy system to ensure that the supply of electricity is matched to demand. Most studies use a working assumption that CCS can capture 85â€“90% of the CO2 emissions from a power plant.</p>
