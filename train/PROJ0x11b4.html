                <p>Green buildings often include measures to reduce energy consumption â€“ both the embodied energy required to extract, process, transport and install building materials and operating energy to provide services such as heating and power for equipment. In 2004, building emissions from electricity use and energy-related carbon dioxide emissions contributed to 33% of the global total emissions.A life cycle assessment (LCA) can help avoid a narrow outlook on environmental, social and economic concerns by assessing a full range of impacts associated with all cradle-to-grave stages of a process: from extraction of raw materials through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or recycling.</p>
