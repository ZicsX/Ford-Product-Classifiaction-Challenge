                <p> In market-based health care systems, for example such as that in the United States, such services are usually paid for by the patient or through the patient's health insurance company. Other mechanisms include government-financed systems (such as the National Health Service in the United Kingdom). However, large public insurance programs provide the government with bargaining power, allowing them to drive down prices for certain services and medication.</p>
