                <p>The relational database model introduced a programming-language independent Structured Query Language (SQL), based on relational algebra. The earliest form of non-volatile computer storage was the magnetic drum, invented in 1932 and used in the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer.
