                <p> More informal terms for programmer also exist such as "coder" and "hacker" â€“ although use of the latter word may cause confusion, because it is more often used to mean someone who illegally breaks into computer systems. These tools may be relatively self-contained programs such as compilers, debuggers, interpreters, linkers, and text editors, that can be combined together to accomplish a task; or they may form an integrated development environment (IDE), which combines much or all of the functionality of such self-contained tools. Companies have also sought to integrate IT with business outcomes and decision-making through a BizOps or business operations department.</p>
