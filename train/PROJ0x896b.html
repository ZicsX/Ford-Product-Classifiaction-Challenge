                <p> Good is generally considered to be the opposite of evil, and is of interest in the study of morality, ethics, religion and philosophy. A sense of moral judgment and a distinction "right and wrong, good and bad" are cultural universals. Gnostic ideas influenced many ancient religions which teach that gnosis (variously interpreted as enlightenment, salvation, emancipation or "oneness with God") may be reached by practising philanthropy to the point of personal poverty, sexual abstinence (as far as possible for hearers, total for initiates) and diligently searching for wisdom by helping others.</p>
