                <p>Hydrogen can be produced through electrolysis, by using electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen; if the electricity is generated sustainably, the resultant fuel will also be sustainable. To accommodate larger shares of variable renewable energy, electrical grids require flexibility through infrastructure such as energy storage. Because the heat is typically stored, this type of solar power is dispatchable: it can be produced when needed.</p>
