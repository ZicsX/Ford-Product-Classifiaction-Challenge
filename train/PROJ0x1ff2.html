                <p> In some countries, a requirement for the claimed invention to have an effect on the physical world may also be part of the requirements for a software patent to be held validâ€”although since all useful software has effects on the physical world, this requirement may be open to debate. In the case of debates about software patents outside the United States, the argument has been made that large American corporations and patent lawyers are likely to be the primary beneficiaries of allowing or continue to allow software patents. In 1995, Paul Niquette claimed he had originally coined the term in October 1953, although he could not find any documents supporting his claim.</p>
