                <p> An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system – including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment – operated by a limited group of IT users. In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, including programs and data.
