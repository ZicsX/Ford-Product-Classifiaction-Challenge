                <p> In Western civilisation, the basic meanings of κακός and ἀγαθός are "bad, cowardly" and "good, brave, capable", and their absolute sense emerges only around 400 BC, with Pre-Socratic philosophy, in particular Democritus. In cultures with Manichaean and Abrahamic religious influence, evil is usually perceived as the antagonistic opposite of good.  This is the recognition of good and evil not being unrelated, but two parts of a greater whole; unity, oneness, a Monism.</p>
