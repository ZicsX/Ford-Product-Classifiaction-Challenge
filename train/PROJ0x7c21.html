                <p>The first theory about software—prior to the creation of computers as we know them today—was proposed by Alan Turing in his 1935 essay, On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem). It is typically proprietary to the processor manufacturer, and any necessary correctional microcode software updates are supplied by them to users (which is much cheaper than shipping replacement processor hardware). In 1995, Paul Niquette claimed he had originally coined the term in October 1953, although he could not find any documents supporting his claim.</p>
