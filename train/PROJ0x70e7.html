                <p> Improvements in energy efficiency slowed in the years between 2015 and 2018, in part because of consumer preferences for bigger cars. There is potential for hydrogen to play a significant role in decarbonising energy systems because in certain sectors, replacing fossil fuels with direct use of electricity would be very difficult. The uranium ore used to fuel nuclear fission plants is a non-renewable resource, but sufficient quantities exist to provide a supply for hundreds of years.</p>
