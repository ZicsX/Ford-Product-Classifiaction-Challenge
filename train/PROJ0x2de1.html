                <p> AC power had an advantage in that transformers, installed at power stations, could be used to raise the voltage from the generators, and transformers at local substations could reduce voltage to supply loads. Heat can be obtained by drilling into the ground and then carried by a heat-transfer fluid such as water, brine or steam. Households without electricity typically use kerosene lamps for lighting, which creates toxic fumes.</p>
