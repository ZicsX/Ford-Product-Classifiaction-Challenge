                <p> As of 2007, almost 94% of the data stored worldwide was held digitally: 52% on hard disks, 28% on optical devices ,and 11% on digital magnetic tape. The first random-access digital storage device was the Williams tube, based on a standard cathode ray tube, but the information stored in it and delay line memory was volatile in that it had to be continuously refreshed, and thus was lost once power was removed.  This is an often overlooked reason for the rapid interest in automation and Artificial Intelligence, but the constant pressure to do more with less is opening the door for automation to take control of at least some minor operations in large companies.</p>
