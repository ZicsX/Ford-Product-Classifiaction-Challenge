                <p>Since it is not possible to know with precision the extent to which something is 'secure' (and a measure of vulnerability is unavoidable), perceptions of security vary, often greatly. Similarly, the increased presence of military personnel on the streets of a city after a terrorist attack may help to reassure the public, whether or not it diminishes the risk of further attacks.Another problem of perception is the common assumption that the mere presence of a security system (such as armed forces, or antivirus software) implies security.</p>
