                <p> Across the globe, manufacturers can be subject to regulations and pollution taxes to offset the environmental costs of manufacturing activities.In the pre-industrial world, most manufacturing occurred in rural areas, where household-based manufacturing served as a supplemental subsistence strategy to agriculture (and continues to do so in places). Labor unions and craft guilds have played a historic role in the negotiation of worker rights and wages.</p>
