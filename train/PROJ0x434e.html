                <p>Transitioning to cleaner cooking methods is expected to either raise greenhouse gas emissions by a minimal amount or decrease them, even if the replacement fuels are fossil gases. Bioenergy production, coal mining and processing, and oil extraction also require large amounts of water. To accommodate larger shares of variable renewable energy, electrical grids require flexibility through infrastructure such as energy storage.</p>
