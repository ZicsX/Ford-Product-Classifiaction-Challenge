                <p> Parma has a mid-latitude, four-season humid subtropical climate (KÃ¶ppen : Cfa) with heavy continental influences due to the city's inland position. For example, Solignano was a Pallavicino family possession until 1805, and San Secondo belonged to the Rossi well into the 19th century. For instance, Chinese hospital charges tend toward 50% for drugs, another major percentage for equipment, and a small percentage for healthcare professional fees.</p>
