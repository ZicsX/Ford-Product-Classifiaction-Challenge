                <p> For more than half of the 770 million people who currently lack access to electricity, decentralised renewable energy solutions such as solar-powered mini-grids are likely to be the cheapest method of providing access by 2030. However, the BECCS process can also result in net positive emissions depending on how the biomass material is grown, harvested, and transported. According to some analyst forecasts, offshore wind power will become cheaper than onshore wind in the mid-2030s.</p>
