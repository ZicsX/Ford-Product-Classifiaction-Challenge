                <p>Onsite generation of renewable energy through solar power, wind power, hydro power, or biomass can significantly reduce the environmental impact of the building. In 1956, the silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) was introduced, increasing the range of power electronic applications. Practices like these provide soil with organic nutrients and create carbon sinks that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, offsetting greenhouse gas emission.</p>
