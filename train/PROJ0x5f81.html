                <p>  This is the recognition of good and evil not being unrelated, but two parts of a greater whole; unity, oneness, a Monism. A sense of moral judgment and a distinction "right and wrong, good and bad" are cultural universals. In Western civilisation, the basic meanings of κακός and ἀγαθός are "bad, cowardly" and "good, brave, capable", and their absolute sense emerges only around 400 BC, with Pre-Socratic philosophy, in particular Democritus.</p>
