                <p> Entrepreneurs organized a number of manufacturing households into a single enterprise through the putting-out system. Morality in this absolute sense solidifies in the dialogues of Plato, together with the emergence of monotheistic thought (notably in Euthyphro, which ponders the concept of piety (τὸ ὅσιον) as a moral absolute). The main characteristic of the factory system is the use of machinery, originally powered by water or steam and later by electricity.</p>
