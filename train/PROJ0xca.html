                <p>Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, probably initially in the form of a tally stick. An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system – including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment – operated by a limited group of IT users.
