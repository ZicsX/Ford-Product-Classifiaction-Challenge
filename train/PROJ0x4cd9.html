                <p>  A cost center is a department or staff which incurs expenses, or “costs”, within a company rather than generating profits or revenue streams. These important inventions led to the development of the personal computer (PC) in the 1970s, and the emergence of information and communications technology (ICT). Most of the world's digital data is unstructured, and stored in a variety of different physical formats even within a single organization.</p>
