                <p>Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity facilities generally have less environmental impact than reservoir-based facilities, but their ability to generate power depends on river flow which can vary with daily and seasonal weather conditions. Power electronics started with the development of the mercury arc rectifier in 1902, used to convert AC into DC. The industry is generally heavily regulated, often with price controls and is frequently government-owned and operated.</p>
