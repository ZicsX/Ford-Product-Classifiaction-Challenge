                <p> Energy demand can be shifted in time through energy demand management and the use of smart grids, matching the times when variable energy production is highest. Little energy is needed for wind turbine construction compared to the energy produced by the wind power plant itself. As larger amounts of solar and wind energy are integrated into the grid, changes have to be made to the energy system to ensure that the supply of electricity is matched to demand.</p>
