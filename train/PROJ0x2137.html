                <p>The relational database model introduced a programming-language independent Structured Query Language (SQL), based on relational algebra.Hilbert and Lopez identify the exponential pace of technological change (a kind of Moore's law): machines' application-specific capacity to compute information per capita roughly doubled every 14 months between 1986 and 2007; the per capita capacity of the world's general-purpose computers doubled every 18 months during the same two decades; the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months; the world's storage capacity per capita required roughly 40 months to double (every 3 years); and per capita broadcast information has doubled every 12. High-level languages are translated into machine language using a compiler or an interpreter or a combination of the two.</p>
