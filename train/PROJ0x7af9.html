                <p>Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development: pre-mechanical (3000 BC – 1450 AD), mechanical (1450–1840), electromechanical (1840–1940), and electronic (1940–present). Software is often also a victim to what is known as software aging, the progressive performance degradation resulting from a combination of unseen bugs.</p>
