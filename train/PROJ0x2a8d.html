                <p> Labor unions and craft guilds have played a historic role in the negotiation of worker rights and wages. The clean-up costs of hazardous waste, for example, may outweigh the benefits of a product that creates it. Such goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other more complex products (such as aircraft, household appliances, furniture, sports equipment or automobiles), or distributed via the tertiary industry to end users and consumers (usually through wholesalers, who in turn sell to retailers, who then sell them to individual customers).</p>
