                <p> However there remains a window of opportunity for many poor countries and regions to "leapfrog" fossil fuel dependency by developing their energy systems based on renewables, given adequate international investment and knowledge transfer. Well-designed government policies that promote energy system transformation can lower greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality simultaneously, and in many cases can also increase energy security. Heat pumps currently provide only 5% of space and water heating requirements globally, but he IEA estimates that they could provide over 90%.</p>
