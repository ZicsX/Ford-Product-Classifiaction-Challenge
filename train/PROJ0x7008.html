                <p> More informal terms for programmer also exist such as "coder" and "hacker" â€“ although use of the latter word may cause confusion, because it is more often used to mean someone who illegally breaks into computer systems. In the waterfall method of software development, separate testing teams are typically employed, but in newer approaches, collectively termed agile software development, developers often do all their own testing, and demonstrate the software to users/clients regularly to obtain feedback. An instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations, for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the user.</p>
