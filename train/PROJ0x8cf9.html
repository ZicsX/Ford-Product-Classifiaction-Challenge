                <p> Wind turbines can also be placed in the ocean, where winds are steadier and stronger than on land but construction and maintenance costs are higher. While both bats and to a lesser extent birds are killed by collisions, these impacts are smaller than from other infrastructure such as windows and transmission lines. The more energy-intensive activities in industry have the lowest shares of renewable energy, as they face limitations in generating heat at temperatures over 200 °C (390 °F).</p>
