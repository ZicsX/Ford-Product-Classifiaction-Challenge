                <p>By the middle of the 20th century, electricity was seen as a "natural monopoly", only efficient if a restricted number of organizations participated in the market; in some areas, vertically-integrated companies provide all stages from generation to retail, and only governmental supervision regulated the rate of return and cost structure. decarbonization strategies have found that quantified health benefits can significantly offset the costs of implementing these strategies. In countries where electricity provision is deregulated, end-users of electricity may opt for more costly green electricity.</p>
