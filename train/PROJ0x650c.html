                <p> If the production of biomass is well-managed, carbon emissions can be significantly offset by the absorption of carbon dioxide by the plants during their lifespans.Governments can accelerate energy system transformation by leading the development of infrastructure such as electrical distribution grids, smart grids and hydrogen pipelines. Ending these could lead to a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths.</p>
