                <p> Wider access to reliable electricity would lead to less use of kerosene lighting and diesel generators, which are currently common in the developing world. This process is currently more expensive than creating hydrogen from fossil fuels, and the efficiency of energy conversion is inherently low. Hydrogen can be produced when there is a surplus of intermittent renewable electricity, then stored and used to generate heat or to re-generate electricity.</p>
