                <p>Although LCA is widely recognized as the best way to evaluate the environmental impacts of buildings (ISO 14040 provides a recognized LCA methodology), it is not yet a consistent requirement of green building rating systems and codes, despite the fact that embodied energy and other life cycle impacts are critical to the design of environmentally responsible buildings. LEED-certified buildings are designed to have healthier, cleaner indoor environmental quality, which means health benefits for occupants.</p>
