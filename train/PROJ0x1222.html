                <p> For a given amount of power transmitted, increasing the voltage reduces the current and therefore reduces the required wire thickness. In already dry regions, this contributes to water scarcity. In 1831, Michael Faraday devised a machine that generated electricity from rotary motion, but it took almost 50 years for the technology to reach a commercially viable stage.</p>
