                <p> AC power had an advantage in that transformers, installed at power stations, could be used to raise the voltage from the generators, and transformers at local substations could reduce voltage to supply loads. The intention is to create zero energy neighborhoods and villages, meaning that they will create by themselves all the needed energy. Green buildings or sustainable buildings are often capable of saving electrical energy but not necessarily reducing peak demand.</p>
