                <p>  This is the recognition of good and evil not being unrelated, but two parts of a greater whole; unity, oneness, a Monism.In most contexts, the concept of good denotes the conduct that should be preferred when posed with a choice between possible actions.Medieval Christian philosophy was founded on the work of the Bishop Augustine of Hippo and theologian Thomas Aquinas who understood evil in terms of Biblical infallibility and Biblical inerrancy, as well as the influences of Plato and Aristotle in their appreciation of the concept of the Summum bonum.</p>
