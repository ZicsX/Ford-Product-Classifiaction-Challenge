                <p> However, some embedded systems run embedded operating systems, and these systems do retain the distinction between system software and application software (although typically there will only be one, fixed application which is always run).

This involves passing instructions from the application software, through the system software, to the hardware which ultimately receives the instruction as machine code.</p>
