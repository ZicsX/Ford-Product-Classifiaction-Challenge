                <p>Renewable energy technologies are essential contributors to sustainable energy, as they generally contribute to global energy security and reduce dependence on fossil fuel resources, thus mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.For some industrial processes, such as steel production, commercialization of technologies that have not yet been built or operated at full scale will be needed to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions.Well-designed government policies that promote energy system transformation can lower greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality simultaneously, and in many cases can also increase energy security.</p>
