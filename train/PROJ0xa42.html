                <p>Historically, transmission and distribution lines were owned by the same company, but starting in the 1990s, many countries have liberalized the regulation of the electricity market in ways that have led to the separation of the electricity transmission business from the distribution business. Generation, transmission and distribution may be offered by a single company, or different organizations may provide each of these portions of the system. Government policies to develop energy-efficient infrastructure can encourage changes in transport modes.</p>
