                <p> Turbine blades are not fully recyclable; research into methods of manufacturing easier-to-recycle blades is ongoing. While such markets can be abusively manipulated with consequent adverse price and reliability impact to consumers, generally competitive production of electrical energy leads to worthwhile improvements in efficiency. Energy demand can be shifted in time through energy demand management and the use of smart grids, matching the times when variable energy production is highest.</p>
