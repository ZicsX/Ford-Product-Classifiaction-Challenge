                <p>The use of energy is considered sustainable if it meets the needs of the present without compromising the needs of future generations.  Urban planning to discourage sprawl can reduce energy use in local transport and buildings while enhancing quality-of-life. Carbon taxes have encountered strong political pushback in some jurisdictions, whereas energy-specific policies tend to be politically safer.</p>
