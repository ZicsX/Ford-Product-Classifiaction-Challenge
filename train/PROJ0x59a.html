                <p>Hydrogen can be burned to produce heat or can power fuel cells to generate electricity, with zero emissions at the point of usage. Wind power, in contrast to nuclear and fossil fuel plants, does not consume water to produce power. For more than half of the 770 million people who currently lack access to electricity, decentralised renewable energy solutions such as solar-powered mini-grids are likely to be the cheapest method of providing access by 2030.</p>
