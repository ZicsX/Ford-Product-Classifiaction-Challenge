                <p> In 1831, Michael Faraday devised a machine that generated electricity from rotary motion, but it took almost 50 years for the technology to reach a commercially viable stage. Nuclear power uses little land per unit of energy produced, compared to the major renewables. Energy demand can be shifted in time through energy demand management and the use of smart grids, matching the times when variable energy production is highest.</p>
