                <p> Increasing the voltage reduced the current in the transmission and distribution lines and hence the size of conductors and distribution losses. There are several key steps in designing sustainable buildings: specify 'green' building materials from local sources, reduce loads, optimize systems, and generate on-site renewable energy.
