                <p> In 2019, solar power provided around 3% of global electricity, mostly through solar panels based on photovoltaic cells (PV).Hydrogen can be burned to produce heat or can power fuel cells to generate electricity, with zero emissions at the point of usage. AC power had an advantage in that transformers, installed at power stations, could be used to raise the voltage from the generators, and transformers at local substations could reduce voltage to supply loads.</p>
