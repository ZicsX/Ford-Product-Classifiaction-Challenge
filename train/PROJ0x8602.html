                <h1> Company information </h1>

                <h2> General Details </h2>
                <p> Company is based out of: <b>nan</b> </p>
                <p> Company Sector: <b>nan</b></p>

                <p> <b>Company background</b> </p>
                <p> One of the sources of controversy is that the aforementioned split between initial ideas and patent does not seem to be honored in practice by patent lawyersâ€”for example the patent for Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), which purported to claim rights over any programming tool implementing the idea of AOP, howsoever implemented. Programs containing command software enable hardware engineering and system operations to function much easier together.  This is an often overlooked reason for the rapid interest in automation and Artificial Intelligence, but the constant pressure to do more with less is opening the door for automation to take control of at least some minor operations in large companies.</p>
