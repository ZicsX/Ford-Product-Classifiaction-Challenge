                <p> When trying to answer such difficult questions pertaining to the definition of justice, Plato identifies that we should not "introduce every form of difference and sameness in nature" instead we must focus on "the one form of sameness and difference that was relevant to the particular ways of life themselves‚Äù which is the form of the Good. The clean-up costs of hazardous waste, for example, may outweigh the benefits of a product that creates it.  It is not only the "cause of knowledge and truth, it is also an object of knowledge".</p>
