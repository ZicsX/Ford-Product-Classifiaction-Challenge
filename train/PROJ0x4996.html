                <p> A sustainable energy system is likely to see a shift towards far more use of electricity in sectors such as transport and heating, energy conservation, and the use of hydrogen produced by renewables or from fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage. Fossil fuel switching and mitigation For a given unit of energy produced, the life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of natural gas are around 40 times the emissions of wind or nuclear energy, but much less than that of coal. In countries where electricity provision is deregulated, end-users of electricity may opt for more costly green electricity.</p>
