                <p> Various projections of future energy use identify solar PV as one of the main sources of energy generation in a sustainable mix. Serious local environmental damage, including desertification, can be caused by excessive harvesting of wood and other combustible material. On average, hydropower ranks among the energy sources with the lowest levels of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy produced, but levels of emissions vary enormously between projects.</p>
