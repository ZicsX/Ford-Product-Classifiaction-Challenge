                <p>The General Dynamics Nexus was proposed in the 1960s as a fully reusable successor to the Saturn V rocket, having the capacity of transporting up to 450–910 t (990,000–2,000,000 lb) to orbit. The first test flight occurred on 6 February 2018, in a configuration in which recovery of all three boosters was attempted, with  Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster of 1,250 kg (2,760 lb) sent to an orbit beyond Mars. Testing of the second stage is underway, and an orbital test of the full rocket is planned for either 2021 or 2022.</p>
