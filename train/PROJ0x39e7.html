                <p>Massive amounts of data are stored worldwide every day, but unless it can be analyzed and presented effectively it essentially resides in what have been called data tombs: "data archives that are seldom visited".

Faults and errors are called "bugs" which are often discovered during alpha and beta testing.</p>
