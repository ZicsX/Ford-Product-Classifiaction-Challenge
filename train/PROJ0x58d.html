                <p> Since photosynthesis only captures a small fraction of the energy in sunlight, and crops require significant amounts of energy to harvest, dry, and transport, a lot of land is needed to produce biomass. Generation of electricity and heat contributes 31% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, use of energy in transport contributes 15%, and use of energy in manufacturing and construction contributes 12%. Average annual investment in low-carbon energy technologies and energy efficiency would need to be upscaled by roughly a factor of six by 2050 compared to 2015.</p>
