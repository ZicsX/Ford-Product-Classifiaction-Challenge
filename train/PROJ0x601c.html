                <p> Many programming language implementations provide the option of using both individual tools or an IDE. In the waterfall method of software development, separate testing teams are typically employed, but in newer approaches, collectively termed agile software development, developers often do all their own testing, and demonstrate the software to users/clients regularly to obtain feedback.Data structures such as hash tables, arrays, and binary trees, and algorithms such as quicksort, can be useful for creating software.</p>
