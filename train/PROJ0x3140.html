                <p>  Batteries typically store electricity for short periods; research is ongoing into technology with sufficient capacity to last through seasons.Although electricity had been known to be produced as a result of the chemical reactions that take place in an electrolytic cell since Alessandro Volta developed the voltaic pile in 1800, its production by this means was, and still is, expensive.Electricity is expected to see growing demand in the future.</p>
