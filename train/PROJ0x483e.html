                <p> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated in 2018, "The costs of achieving nearly universal access to electricity and clean fuels for cooking and heating are projected to be between 72 and 95 billion USD per year until 2030 with minimal effects on GHG emissions.Building gas-fired power plants and gas pipelines is promoted as a way to phase out coal and wood burning pollution, and increase energy supply in some African countries with fast growing populations or economies, however this practice is controversial. Improvements in energy efficiency slowed in the years between 2015 and 2018, in part because of consumer preferences for bigger cars.</p>
