                <p> Wind power As a clean energy source, wind has been an important driver of development over millennia, providing transport over sea and mechanical energy for industrial processes and land reclamation. Reservoirs provide water quantity controls that are used for flood control and flexible electricity generation output while also providing security during drought for drinking water supply and irrigation. Hydrogen can be produced when there is a surplus of intermittent renewable electricity, then stored and used to generate heat or to re-generate electricity.</p>
