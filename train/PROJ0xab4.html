                <p> In the EU, all medical devices must be identified with the CE mark. Although these bodies often collaborate and discuss the definition in general, there are subtle differences in wording that prevent a global harmonization of the definition of a medical device, thus the appropriate definition of a medical device depends on the region. While up to 70% of medical equipment in sub-Saharan Africa is donated, only 10%â€“30% of donated equipment becomes operational.</p>
