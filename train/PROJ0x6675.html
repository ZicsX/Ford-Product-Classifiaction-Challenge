                <p> All databases are common in one point that the structure of the data they contain is defined and stored separately from the data itself, in a database schema.  These titles can be misleading at times and should not be mistaken for “tech companies”; which are generally large scale, for-profit corporations that sell consumer technology and software. Until 2002 most information was stored on analog devices, but that year digital storage capacity exceeded analog for the first time.</p>
