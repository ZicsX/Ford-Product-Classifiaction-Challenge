                <p>Historically, transmission and distribution lines were owned by the same company, but starting in the 1990s, many countries have liberalized the regulation of the electricity market in ways that have led to the separation of the electricity transmission business from the distribution business. Distribution transformers again lower the voltage to the utilization voltage used by lighting, industrial equipment or household appliances.Electricity is expected to see growing demand in the future.</p>
