                <p> Aviation biofuel may be one of the better uses of bioenergy, providing that some carbon is captured and stored during manufacture of the fuel. With grid energy storage, energy produced in excess can be released when needed. In many places, wind and solar production are complementary on a daily and a seasonal scale: There is more wind during the night and in winter, when solar energy production is low.</p>
