                <p> Natural gas produces around half the emissions of coal when used to generate electricity, and around two-thirds the emissions of coal when used to produce heat. Technology will probably eventually declare the most preferred forms, but in a market economy, the options with less overall costs generally will be chosen above other sources.Renewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectric power, solar, and geothermal energy are generally far more sustainable than fossil fuel sources.</p>
