                <p> Wind power, in contrast to nuclear and fossil fuel plants, does not consume water to produce power.Concentrated solar power uses mirrors to produce heat, which drives a heat engine. If 90% of emitted CO2 is captured from a coal-fired power plant, its uncaptured emissions would still be many times greater than the emissions of nuclear, solar, or wind energy per unit of electricity produced.</p>
