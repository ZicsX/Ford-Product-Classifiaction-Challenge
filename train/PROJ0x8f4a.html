                <p> Parma was liberated from the German occupation (1943â€“1945) on 26 April 1945 by the partisan resistance and the Brazilian Expeditionary Force. During the Middle Ages, Parma became an important stage of the Via Francigena, the main road connecting Rome to Northern Europe; several castles, hospitals and inns were built in the following centuries to host the increasing number of pilgrims who passed by Parma and Fidenza, following the Apennines via Collecchio, Berceto and the Corchia ranges before descending the Passo della Cisa into Tuscany, heading finally south toward Rome.</p>
