                <p> In 1878, in the United States, Thomas Edison developed and sold a commercially viable replacement for gas lighting and heating using locally generated and distributed direct current electricity. It defined sustainable development as development that "meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Climate change mitigation pathways that are consistent with ambitious goals typically see an increase in power supply from nuclear, but growth is not strictly necessary.</p>
