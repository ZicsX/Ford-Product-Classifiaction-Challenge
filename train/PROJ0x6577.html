                <p>  IT departments are allocated funds by senior leadership and must attempt to achieve the desired deliverables while staying within that budget.Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development: pre-mechanical (3000 BC – 1450 AD), mechanical (1450–1840), electromechanical (1840–1940), and electronic (1940–present). Data warehouses began to be developed in the 1980s to integrate these disparate stores.</p>
