                <p> In market-based health care systems, for example such as that in the United States, such services are usually paid for by the patient or through the patient's health insurance company.  The UK National Health System creates excellent patient outcomes and mandates universal coverage but also suffers from large lag times for treatment. In this system, insurance is mandated by the government and is typically sold on a non-profit basis.</p>
