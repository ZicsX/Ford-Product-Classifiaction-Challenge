                <p> Since photosynthesis only captures a small fraction of the energy in sunlight, and crops require significant amounts of energy to harvest, dry, and transport, a lot of land is needed to produce biomass. The cost of electricity from new solar farms is competitive with, or in many places cheaper than, electricity from existing coal plants. About 840 million people (mostly in Africa) had no access in 2017, down from 1.</p>
