                <p>The energy intensity of the global economy (the energy needed per unit of GDP) has been gradually decreasing for decades, so that growth in energy demand is slowly becoming decoupled from economic growth. In some cases, these impacts can actually result in higher overall carbon emissions compared to using petroleum-based fuels. Deployment of BECCS at scales described in some climate change mitigation pathways would also require converting large amounts of cropland.</p>
