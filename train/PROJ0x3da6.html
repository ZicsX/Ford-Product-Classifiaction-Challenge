                <p> Malware is closely associated with computer-related crimes, though some malicious programs may have been designed as practical jokes. However, software testing rarely—if ever—eliminates every bug; some programmers say that "every program has at least one more bug" (Lubarsky's Law).A person who creates software is called a programmer, software engineer or software developer, terms that all have a similar meaning.</p>
