                <p> Across the globe, manufacturers can be subject to regulations and pollution taxes to offset the environmental costs of manufacturing activities.In addition to general overviews, researchers have examined the features and factors affecting particular key aspects of manufacturing development. Such goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other more complex products (such as aircraft, household appliances, furniture, sports equipment or automobiles), or distributed via the tertiary industry to end users and consumers (usually through wholesalers, who in turn sell to retailers, who then sell them to individual customers).</p>
