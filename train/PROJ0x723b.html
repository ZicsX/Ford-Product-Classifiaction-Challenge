                <p> Energy storage Energy storage helps overcome barriers for intermittent renewable energy, and is therefore an important aspect of a sustainable energy system. As larger amounts of solar and wind energy are integrated into the grid, changes have to be made to the energy system to ensure that the supply of electricity is matched to demand. Nuclear power uses little land per unit of energy produced, compared to the major renewables.</p>
