                <p> In 1956, the silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) was introduced, increasing the range of power electronic applications. Generations of MOSFETs enabled power designers to achieve performance and density levels not possible with bipolar transistors.Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity facilities generally have less environmental impact than reservoir-based facilities, but their ability to generate power depends on river flow which can vary with daily and seasonal weather conditions.</p>
